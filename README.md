# HomeAssignment1

## First session
- We met up on Febr 25 to discuss the initial steps. We started working on the project, for example created the initial version of the UI and the logic behind the different classes. You can see the commits made during this time on GitHub.

## Individual work
- We split up the work as follows:
-- Annalena: [branch: pixelgrid]
    - created the buttons for each pixel, which would change colour once clicked
    - the Pixel list also gets updated
-- Emma: [branch: loading]
    - made a stand in picture before loading the actual image.txt 
    - set the filename and the size in the UI (filename is changeable)
    - made the 'load' button work
-- Gabija:
    - made the 'save' button work
    - started on putting a * after the window title, when it's edited but not saved

## Second session
- We met up on March 1 to finish the assignment. What we did:
    - merged our individual code snippets
    - made the UI prettier
    - finished the work with the * after the window title
    - chose and implemented an extra task: flipping the image vertically and horizontally
    - cleaned and formatted the code for easier readability
